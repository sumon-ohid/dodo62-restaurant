# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
User wants to modify the hero section in the animated-hero.tsx component to position it more towards the top for desktop view. Additionally, user wants to add a grid of images (img-1.png to img-4.png) after the hero section with dashed borders. User also wants to add the logo.png to the footer. User wants to make the "Call us now" and "Make Reservation" buttons functional.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Current hero section uses `min-h-screen` and centers content vertically
- Need to adjust positioning to move content higher on desktop
- Maintain responsive design for mobile devices

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Analyze current hero layout** - Review the current positioning and styling
2. **Modify desktop positioning** - Adjust the hero section to be positioned higher on desktop
3. **Add image grid section** - Create a grid layout with img-1.png to img-4.png from public/assets
4. **Style with dashed borders** - Apply dashed border styling to the image grid
5. **Test responsiveness** - Ensure mobile layout remains intact
6. **Verify visual appearance** - Check that the new positioning and grid look good

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
✅ Completed: Modified hero section positioning
- Changed `items-center` to `items-start lg:items-start` to align content to top
- Added `pt-8 lg:pt-16` for top padding to provide some spacing from the very top
- This moves the hero content higher on desktop while maintaining mobile responsiveness

✅ Completed: Added image grid section
- Created separate ImageGrid component in src/components/homepage/ImageGrid.tsx
- Added ImageGrid component after Hero in main page layout (src/app/page.tsx)
- Created responsive grid layout (2 columns on mobile, 4 columns on desktop)
- Used images img-1.png through img-4.png from public/assets directory
- Applied dashed borders with `border-2 border-dashed border-gray-300`
- Added hover effects and smooth animations with staggered delays
- Removed image grid from animated-hero component to keep it separate
- ✅ Reduced gap between hero and image grid (py-12 lg:py-16 → py-2 lg:py-4)
- ✅ Added logo.png to footer in src/components/layout/Footer.tsx
- ✅ Made logo bigger (h-8 md:h-10 → h-12 md:h-16) and increased margin (mr-3 → mr-4)
- ✅ Added functionality to hero buttons:
  - "Call us now" button opens phone dialer with +436643450615
  - "Make Reservation" button smoothly scrolls to contact section
